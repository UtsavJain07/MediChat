It is performed twice,\\nfirst at one minute and then again at five minutes after\\nbirth.\\nPurpose\\nApgar scoring was originally developed in the\\n1950s by the anesthesiologist Virginia Apgar to assist\\npractitioners attending a birth in deciding whether or\\nnot a newborn was in need of resuscitation. Using a\\nscoring method fosters consistency and standardiza-\\ntion among different practitioners. A February 2001\\nstudy published in the New England Journal of\\nMedicine investigated whether Apgar scoring con-\\ntinues to be relevant. Researchers concluded that\\n‘‘The Apgar scoring system remains as relevant for\\nthe prediction of neonatal survival today as it was\\nalmost 50 years ago.’’\\nDescription\\nThe five areas are scored as follows:\\n/C15Appearance, or color: 2 if the skin is pink all over; 1\\nfor acrocyanosis, where the trunk and head are pink,\\nbut the arms and legs are blue; and 0 if the whole\\nbody is blue. Newborns with naturally darker skin\\ncolor will not be pink. However, pallor is still notice-\\nable, especially in the soles and palms. Color is\\nrelated to the neonate’s ability to oxygenate its\\nbody and extremities, and is dependent on heart\\nrate and respirations. A perfectly healthy newborn\\nwill often receive a score of 9 because of some blue-\\nness in the hands and feet.\\n/C15Pulse (heart rate): 2 for a pulse of 100+ beats per\\nminute (bpm); 1 for a pulse below 100 bpm; 0 for no\\npulse. Heart rate is assessed by listening with a\\nstethoscope to the newborn’s heart and counting\\nthe number of beats.\\n/C15Grimace, or reflex irritability: 2 if the neonate\\ncoughs, sneezes, or vigorously cries in response to a\\nstimulus (such as the use of nasal suctioning, stroking\\nthe back to assess for spinal abnormalities, or having\\nthe foot tapped); 1 for a slight cry or grimace in\\nresponse to the stimulus; 0 for no response.\\n/C15Activity, or muscle tone: 2 for vigorous movements\\nof arms and legs; 1 for some movement; 0 for no\\nmovement, limpness.\\n/C15Respirations: 2 for visible breathing and crying; 1\\nfor slow, weak, irregular breathing; 0 for apnea,\\nor no breathing. A crying newborn can ade-\\nquately oxygenate its lungs. Respirations are best\\nassessed by watching the rise and fall of the neo-\\nnate’s abdomen, as inf ants are diaphragmatic\\nbreathers.\\nThe combined first letters in these five areas spell\\nApgar.\\nPreparation\\nNo preparation is needed to perform the test.\\nHowever, while being born the neonate may receive\\nnasal and oral suctioning to remove mucus and\\namniotic fluid. This may be done when the head of\\nthe newborn is safely out, while the mother rests\\nbefore she continues to push.\\nAftercare\\nSince the test is primarily observational in nature,\\nno aftercare is needed. However, the test may flag the\\nneed for immediate intervention or prolonged\\nobservation.\\nNormal results\\nThe maximum possible score is 10, the minimum\\nis zero. It is rare to receive a true 10, as some acrocya-\\nnosis in the newborn is considered normal, and there-\\nfore not a cause for concern. Most infants score\\nbetween 7 and 10. These infants are expected to have\\nan excellent outcome. A score of 4, 5, or 6 requires\\nimmediate intervention, usually in the form of oxygen\\nand respiratory assistance, or perhaps just suctioning\\nif breathing has been obstructed by mucus. While\\nsuctioning is being done, a source of oxygen may be\\nplaced near, but not over the newborn’s nose and\\nmouth. This form of oxygen is referred to asblow-by.\\nA score in the 4-6 range indicates that the neonate is\\nhaving some difficulty adapting to extrauterine life.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 371\\nApgar testing')"
